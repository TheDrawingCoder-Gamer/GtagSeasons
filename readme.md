# Gorilla Tag Seasons

seasons mod :)

Changes seasons. Works in modded lobbies.


This will send the appropiate sound mapped to the material. This means other players can notice that you have, say, grass sounds and not snow sounds. 

Lighting is baked, meaning new objects will have no lighting and old objects being removed will keep their lighting. 

## todo

swap out baked lighting to fix odd shadows
